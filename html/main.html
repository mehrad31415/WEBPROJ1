                <h2 class="h2--position h2--text-attributes">Plot Summary</h2>
                <p>The film opens with the camera looking up at the imposing pillars of justice outside Manhattan's Court of
                    General Sessions on a summer afternoon. The subjective camera wanders about inside the marbled interior
                    rotunda and hallways, and on the second floor haphazardly makes its way into a double-doored room marked
                    228. There, a bored-sounding, non-committal judge (Rudy Bond) wearily instructs the twelve-man jury to
                    begin their deliberations after listening to six days of a "long and complex case of murder in the first
                    degree." He admonishes them that it is a case involving the serious charge of pre-meditated murder with
                    a mandatory death sentence upon a guilty verdict, and now it is the jury's duty to "separate the facts
                    from the fancy" because "one man is dead" and "another man's life is at stake." </p>
                <p>The judge states the important criteria for judgment regarding "reasonable doubt," as the camera pans
                    across the serious faces of the jury members:</p>
                <p>If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the guilt of the accused, a reasonable doubt, then you
                    must bring me a verdict of not guilty. If however, there is no reasonable doubt, then you must in good
                    conscience find the accused guilty. However you decide, your verdict must be unanimous. In the event
                    that you find the accused guilty, the bench will not entertain a recommendation for mercy. The death
                    sentence is mandatory in this case. You are faced with a grave responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
                <p>As the jury leaves the box and retires to the jury room to deliberate, the camera presents a side-view
                    and then a lingering, silent closeup of the innocent-faced, frightened, despondent slum boy defendant
                    with round, sad brown eyes. [His ethnicity, whether he's Puerto Rican or Hispanic, is unspecified.] The
                    plaintiff musical theme of the film (a solo flute tune by Kenyon Hopkins) plays as the claustrophobic,
                    bare-walled, stark jury room (with a water cooler in the corner and a dysfunctional mounted wall fan)
                    dissolves into view - and the credits are reviewed.</p>
