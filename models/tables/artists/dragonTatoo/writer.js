const about = 'Larsson was a well-respected investigative journalist who wrote extensively on far-right extremism and anti-democratic movements in Sweden. He was also an expert in computer technology and founded the Swedish Expo Foundation, which worked to expose and combat right-wing extremism in the country. Unfortunately, Larsson passed away in 2004 before the publication of his Millennium series, and as a result, he never got to see the tremendous success his novels would achieve. His books have sold millions of copies worldwide and have been adapted into successful films and television series. They have also sparked renewed interest in the crime fiction genre and helped to popularize the use of complex, flawed, and unconventional female characters in literature.';
