const about = 'Reginald Rose was born in Manhattan on December 10, 1920, the son of Alice (n√©e Obendorfer) and William Rose, a lawyer. Rose attended Townsend Harris High School and briefly attended City College (now part of the City University of New York). He served in the U.S. Army during World War II, from 1942-46, where he was promoted to first lieutenant. Rose began trying to write when he was 15 years old and living in Harlem, but he said, "I didn\'t make it until I was 30." In the interim, he worked as an ad agency\'s copywriter, a publicist for Warner Bros, a window washer, a clerk, and a counselor at a camp.';
