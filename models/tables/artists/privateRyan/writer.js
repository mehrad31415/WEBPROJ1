const about = 'Rodat has a deep interest in history, particularly in the events surrounding World War II, which has influenced his writing. He has said that he was inspired to write "Saving Private Ryan" after learning about the real-life story of the Niland brothers, four siblings who served in the U.S. military during World War II. Three of the brothers died in combat, and the fourth was sent home after it was discovered that his three brothers had been killed. This story served as the basis for the plot of "Saving Private Ryan." In addition to his work in the film industry, Rodat has also been involved in various philanthropic efforts. He has been a longtime supporter of organizations that focus on environmental conservation and promoting social justice.';
