const plot = `Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is pulled from her regimen at the Quantico FBI Academy by her boss, Jack Crawford. He assigns her to interview Hannibal Lecter, an incarcerated former psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer, on the pretense of persuading Lecter to answer a questionnaire about himself for the Bureau's psychological profiles, but secretly hoping to gain his insights about a psychopath serial killer nicknamed "Buffalo Bill," who kills young women and removes their skin from their bodies.

At the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Frederick Chilton escorts Starling to Lecter's cell. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's interviewing and rebuffs her, deducing Crawford's true motive and refusing to help. As she is leaving, a prisoner flicks semen at her, angering Lecter. He calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his, which leads her to a storage facility where she discovers a jar containing a man's severed head. She returns to Lecter, who says the man is linked to Buffalo Bill, and offers to profile the suspect on the condition that he is transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Meanwhile, another victim is found with a death's head moth lodged in her throat.

In Tennessee, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of a U.S. senator. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them capture Buffalo Bill in time to rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo from Starling, offering clues in exchange for her personal information. Starling tells Lecter about her father's murder when she was a child. Chilton eavesdrops on their conversation and exposes Starling's deceit to Lecter before offering him a new deal. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he meets Senator Martin, giving her accurate information on Buffalo Bill's appearance but falsely states his name is "Louis Friend."

Starling figures out that the name is an anagram of "iron sulfide"â€”fool's gold. She visits Lecter, now imprisoned in a cell in Tennessee, and requests the truth. Lecter says all the information she needs is in the Buffalo Bill case file, then insists on continuing their quid pro quo. She recounts a traumatic childhood incident of hearing spring lambs being slaughtered. Lecter speculates that Starling hopes that saving Catherine will end the recurring nightmares she has of lambs screaming, and gains satisfaction from this shared revelation. Lecter returns the case files to Starling as Chilton arrives and has the police escort her out. Later that evening, Lecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears.

Starling analyzes Lecter's file annotations and figures out that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim, Frederika Bimmel. Starling travels to Bimmel's Ohio hometown and discovers that she and Buffalo Bill were both tailors. At Bimmel's home, Starling finds dress patterns identical to the patches of skin removed from the victim and phones Crawford to tell him that Buffalo Bill is making a "suit" with human skin. Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter's notes with hospital archives and finding a man named Jame Gumb, who believes he is transsexual but was deemed too violent to apply for a sex-change operation. Crawford and an FBI Hostage Rescue Team storm Gumb's address in Illinois, finding the house empty. Meanwhile, Starling follows a lead from one of Bimmel's friends, which takes her to the house of one of her former clients. At the house, she meets "Jack Gordon," but realizes he is Gumb after spotting a death's head moth flying loose. She pursues him into a cavernous basement and finds Catherine trapped in a dry well. In a dark room, Gumb stalks Starling with night-vision goggles, but reveals himself by cocking his revolver. Starling reacts quickly and shoots Gumb dead.

At the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at a Bimini airport. He assures her that he has no intention of pursuing her and requests that she return the favor, which she says she cannot. Lecter subsequently hangs up the phone because he is "having an old friend for dinner". He trails a newly-arrived Chilton into the crowd.`;
