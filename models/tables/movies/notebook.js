const plot = `At a modern-day nursing home, an elderly man named Duke reads a romantic story from his notebook to a female patient, which tells the following:`

+ `\nIn 1940, at a carnival in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, poor lumber mill worker Noah Calhoun sees 17-year-old heiress Allison "Allie" Hamilton, who is spending the summer in town with her parents. He pursues her and they begin a summer romance. One night, Allie goes to Noah's house and meets his father, Frank Calhoun, who immediately likes her. A few days later, Noah is invited to a luncheon at Allie's house by her parents, John and Anne Hamilton, but they are unimpressed with Noah because he doesn't fit in with the other wealthy attendees. The same night, Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house called The Windsor Plantation. He tells her he intends to buy and restore the house for themselves. As the sun sets, they share a romantic moment and Allie asks Noah to make love to her for the first time. But then she grows nervous and starts rambling. They are interrupted by Noah's friend, Fin who informs them that Allie's parents have the police out looking for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, particularly Allie's mother, Anne makes it clear that they do not approve of the relationship and forbid her from seeing him. Overhearing all the insults and how Allie's mother describes him as trash, Noah leaves and Allie goes after him. An argument ensues and Allie breaks up with Noah but she immediately regrets it and tries to stop him. The next morning, Anne announces that the family would be returning home to Charleston and they would be leaving in a while. Allie tries to find Noah at work but fails. So she asks Fin to tell him she loves him. Noah rushes to Allie's house after Fin gives him the message but finds the gates locked.`

+ `\nNoah writes a letter to Allie every day for a year but Allie's mother hides them. When all of Noah's 365 letters go unanswered, Noah stops writing and decides to move on. He enlists with Fin to fight in World War II, Battle of the Bulge where Fin loses his life in battle. Allie volunteers as a nurse in a hospital for wounded soldiers where she meets Captain Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money. After a few years, the two become engaged, much to the delight of Allie's parents.`

+ `\nNoah returns from the war to find that his father had sold their home so Noah could afford to buy The Windsor Plantation. He convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will find her way back to him. Despite completing the house, Noah restrains from selling it to any buyers. While Allie tries on her wedding dress, she sees a photo of Noah in a newspaper where he stands smiling in front of the renovated house. She faints.`

+ `\nAllie is overwhelmed with the memories of summer romance and unresolved feelings for Noah and seeks permission from Lon to take a solo trip before the wedding. She returns to Seabrook to find Noah living in their dream house. The two rekindle and consummate their relationship. Allie learns about the letters Noah had written to her and she realizes she never got them. Several days later, Allie's mother appears on Noah's doorstep to warn Allie that Lon has followed her to Seabrook. She also reveals that like her daughter, she once loved a lower-class young man in Seabrook and still thinks about him and how their lives might have been different had she chosen better. She hands over Noah's letters to Allie and tells her she hopes Allie makes the right choice. Noah and Allie get into a heated argument where the former forces the latter to think about what she wants and to stick by it no matter how hard it is. Allie makes the difficult choice to drive back to her hotel and confess her infidelity to Lon. Lon says he still loves her and wants her back for himself but even though she knows she shouldn't leave Lon, she decides to follow her heart and returns to Noah.`

+ `\nIn the present, the elderly woman listening to the story is revealed to be Allie, now suffering from dementia. Noah who now goes by Duke so as not to startle her in her disoriented state, is her husband. During the early stages of her illness, Allie had written a journal detailing their romance and life together so he could read it to her to help her come back to him. Noah has kept the promise by reading to her almost every day. One day, when he is almost at the end of the story, reading from the notebook, she briefly recognizes him. She asks how long they have before she forgets again and Duke tells her they have no more than five minutes. They dance to their song, "I'll Be Seeing You", and she asks him about their kids. But Allie's dementia quickly relapses and she panics to see a stranger touching her. The medical personnel sedate her to control her hysterical reaction. Duke has a heart attack and is treated in the nursing home while Allie is taken to rest in the dementia ward. Upon recovering and despite not being allowed in, Duke goes to Allie's room in the night and watches her sleep. She instantly recognizes him again. They kiss, hold hands and fall asleep. In the morning, the nurse discovers both of them dead in their sleep, still holding hands.`;
