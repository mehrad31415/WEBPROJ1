                            tribute to 12 Angry Men. The major twists are originally 10 jurors vote for "not guilty" due to self
                            defense, Jessica votes "unsure" and another juror votes "guilty". Jessica and other jurors recall
                            the evidence, as more and more jurors switch from "not guilty due to self defense" and come to a
                            realization as to what actually occurred the night of the murder.
